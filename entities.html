        <p class="articleText">Old Red-eye is a folk tale from the area of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Pine_Barrens" target="_blank" class="navlinkDark">Pine
            Barrens</a>, in the state of New Jersey.
          It is believed to be a bipedal primate, possible a relative of its west coast counterpart, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot" target="_blank" class="navlinkDark">Sasquatch</a>. <br>
          Its not inaccurate to describe the creature as a mountain of matted, black fur, with some of its only
          distinguishable features being its lanky limbs, and the eerie, red glow of its eyes. <br>
          Approach with caution if at all, Red-eye is known to be quite territorial, and its surmised that a not
          insignifigant amount of the hikers that go missing in the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Pine_Barrens" target="_blank" class="navlinkDark">Pine

        <h1 class="name">House-Sitters</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="articleDescription">
        <p class="articleText">House-sitters are a variety of lingering spirit that is bound to a specific abode,
          usually one they used to inhabit or that they were tasked with taking care of. Often times they are unaware of
          their own death, and are just operating off of memories of their old responsibilities. <br> Largely harmless,
          these
          spirits will follow whatever routine or standards they held in life, such as keeping a space clean,
          maintaining a collection of sentimental items, or even tending to guests. However, like most spirits, they are
          not to be taken lightly, as actions that go against a house-sitters goals can cause them to label someone an
          unwanted guest. <br> A house-sitter will take any effort to remove an unwanted guest, this can depend on their
          temperament in life, and usually starts polite but firm. If these initial warnings are ignored, an
          investigator risks being sent much more intense and possibly even dangerous messages. The best way to deal
          with these spectres is to follow their rules, which must be gleaned from context clues, based on how the house
          is maintained, and any information you have on its inhabitants from years past. If you respect their dwelling,
          you should be safe to explore without fear of repercussions, and may even find yourself a temporary ally.

        <h1 class="name">Keepers</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="articleDescription">
        <p class="articleText">Keepers are a variant of house-sitter, with the key distinction that their goal in life
          was to guard a location against intruders, or to prevent a specific oject from falling into the wrong hands.
          These spirits are much more territorial and violent than their homebody counterparts, and must be regarded
          with extreme caution. <br> Overall one should avoid a place that is being watched by a keeper unless
          absolutely necessary. However, in events where it is necessary to cross into their territory, it is best to
          study them for a while beforehand, to get an idea of their habits and routines. Once you have an idea of where
          they spend most of their time, and the areas they avoid, you'll have a much better idea of what areas are safe
          to traverse and when. <br> If your attempts at stealth are unsuccessful and you are spotted, run immediately.
          You will not get a polite warning from a keeper, and the price of whatever equipment you have to leave behind
          is note worth your own life.
